# Hallo

This is a mini-hangman game that is partially (maybe) based on webscraping and stuff. 

Its le very difficult, maybe adding clues later (me lazy). And just go try it. Thanks


Actual instructions:
1. open game.py
2. run in any way that you like (if you want to move anything, remember to move game.py and scrape.py together)
